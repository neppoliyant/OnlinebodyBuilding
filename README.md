To fill the gap between Trainer and Trainee created a portal to communicate like personal training.  With this portal trainees can find online trainers and search using location. After successful subscription trainer will provide weekly training details and chat via messaging service. Training details will contain pictures and sample video. In future will planing to provide video call service as well. So that as per the service package trainee will make video call to trainer and while in gym itself user can get trained. Using WebRTC technology. This is implemented for both web and mobile platform. Created separated view to get all the trainers from database.
